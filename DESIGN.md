# Design

rust-wl-idle-manager watches the compositor's idle notifications and, for now,
logs them. This document records why it works the way it does.

## Idle detection

Idleness comes from the Wayland `ext-idle-notify-v1` protocol. Each configured
timeout gets its own notification, created with the timeout's delay, so the
compositor does the timing and sends `idled` and `resumed` for each one
separately. Events are reported by the timeout's position in the config.
The notifications use the first `wl_seat`; niri has a single seat.

By default a notification is created with `get_idle_notification`, which
respects idle inhibitors: while a client inhibits idling (e.g. a playing
video), the timeout does not fire. A timeout with `ignore-inhibit` uses
`get_input_idle_notification` instead, which counts only input. That request
needs version 2 of `ext_idle_notifier_v1`; with an older compositor, a config
that uses `ignore-inhibit` is an error at startup.

## Event loop

The daemon runs on a single-threaded tokio runtime. The Wayland connection's
file descriptor is registered with tokio through `AsyncFd`, and events are read
with wayland-client's `prepare_read` and `read`, so no second event loop or
thread is needed.

## Losing the compositor

When the compositor goes away, reading from the Wayland socket fails. The
daemon logs the error and exits with status 1, so a service manager can
restart it. It does not try to reconnect.

## Logging

rust-wl-idle-manager logs to journald, falling back to stderr when journald is
unavailable. Values are interpolated into the message text rather than attached
as structured fields, because `journalctl` shows only the message by default.

## Exit status

rust-wl-idle-manager exits with 0 on SIGTERM and 1 on any error. Each error is
logged once; on compositor loss, wayland-backend also prints its own line to
stderr, which reaches the journal. Command-line usage errors exit with 2.
